I really did try to get the test running, but it won't work, I'm sorry. If I'm missing something, and they can get configured correctly I'll gladly show you that I know how to do them.

Otherwise, the basic functionality of everthing is there.

I've literally had 6 hours of sleep this weekend trying to get this in some sort of shape and to be defeated by the testing is very upsetting. Hopefully this does not disqualify me too much.
